                      A gifted schoolboy rugby player, Richard specialised in

                  <p>
                    John Ystumllyn â€“ who is also known by the names Jack Du or
                    Jack Black â€“ was a gardener in the 18th century. He was the
                    first black person in Wales who people wrote about. <br />
                    <br /> We do not know where John originally lived before he
                    arrived in Wales. He possible came here as a victim of the
                    Atlantic slave trade when he was eight years of age, which
                    may mean he came from the West Africa or the West Indies.
                    Once in Wales, John came to live with the Wynn family as a
                    servant at their Ystumllyn estate in Criccieth, where he was
                    christened with the Welsh name John Ystumllyn. <br />
                    <br /> John was taught English and Welsh by the local people
                    and also learned how to be a gardener on the estate where he
                    became very good at his job. John had his portrait painted
                    when he was a young man and it shows that he was very
                    handsome.
                    <br />
                    <br /> John fell in love with a white local maid called
                    Margaret Gruffydd. In 1768, when Margaret left for another
                    job, John left his gardening job to marry her. Theirs may
                    have been the first mixed marriage in Wales. They had seven
                    children, five of whom survived. John and Margaret then
                    worked as land stewards. Later, John went back into the
                    employment of the Wynn family. Ellis Wynn gave him a large
                    garden and cottage at Y Nhyra Isa to say thank you for all
                    his hard work.
                    <br />
                    <br /> John was a very likeable person. He also is known to
                    have not suffered much racial prejudice, though locals did
                    often express surprise at seeing a black man for the first
                    time. John died in 1786; his wife, Margaret, lived for more
                    than forty years more. <br />
                    <br />
                    Many years after his death, a small monument was built near
                    where John was buried in St Cynhaearn's Church. Recently,
                    Zehra Zaidi, the founder of We Too Built Britain, approached
                    the Chelsea flower show winner Harkness Roses with the idea
                    of creating a rose named after John Ystumllyn. The beautiful
                    rose is yellow, symbolising friendship.
