                  Tired, today was a very long day in the laundry. I left this
                  house at 6:30am, I only had half an hour to eat my lunch and
                  then back to work until 8:00pm. I've never worked as hard in
                  my life! Washing, scrubbing, drying and ironing clothes all
                  day long! No energy to write any more!

                  It was a special day here in Wales yesterday, Christmas Day.
                  Lots of houses are decorated and many people go around singing
                  carols. Welsh people are great singers! But things haven't
                  changed much in my life, unfortunately: work, work and more
                  work! But as Chi Mau always says, we have to work harder than
                  everyone else to build a solid foundation for our new life
                  here in Wales! I know he's right but I never thought it would
                  be as hard as this for us.

                  I burnt myself badly today when ironing! I'm in pain but I've
                  had an ointment to rub into my hand. I'm sure that Ming Ming
                  understands that I'm injured because she's doing her best to
                  lift my spirits by doing mad things like trying to catch her
                  own tail. She's so funny.

                  I'm longing for home! It's Mum's birthday today, I hope she's
                  had a good day back in China. It feels as if she's further
                  away than ever today, for some reason. Everything is so
                  different here in Wales, the language, the food, the clothes
                  people wear. I sometimes feel that everyone is staring at me
                  as I walk to work. Some whisper to each other as I go by, I'm
                  sure they're talking about me. But perhaps that's to be
                  expected, as I look so different to everyone else living here!
